<h1>My City is called vernaroo </h1>
<p>my home is in a small building pushed together near 2 other big complexes. my home is very small and often have to wear a mask to work due to poor air quality. we use to have a huge windturbind that would power everything and blow the smoke away. however as time progressed it began to lay dormint. turning my home as we know it, into a place known as "city covered in smoke" often impossible to see through even for sailors.</p>
